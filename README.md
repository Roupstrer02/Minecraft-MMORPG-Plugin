# Zelandris Minecraft MMO
## DEMO VIDEO - Boss fight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk1RmvYLqv8
### What it is
Zelandris is an overhaul plaugin that adds an entirely **new combat system**, **stats**, and **mob loot** to the game, allowing for entirely **new mechanics and systems**:
### - Spell casting
### - Wand crafting
### - Rune crafting
### - Joining raid parties with friends
### - Intense Boss fights

## Artisans
For those of you who aren't really the "Becoming all-powerful" type, no need to worry, because fighters can only get so far without the help of artisans!
Becoming an expert artisan allows you to craft **unique items** that **boost the abilities of players**, Artisan fields include:
### - cooking
### - smithing (coming soon...)
### - improved rune crafting (coming soon...)
The plugin is entirely server-side, meaning players need no additional downloads to join.
